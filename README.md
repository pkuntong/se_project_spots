# Project 6: Spots

An image sharing site. 

## Description

I'm wrapping up Sprint 6 of the TripleTen Software Engineering course, working on 'Spots,' a social media web app where users can add, remove, and like photos, as well as edit their profile name. The project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follows a Figma design brief.
